# 📧 Day 7 - Email Validator & Username Extractor

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to **Day 7** of my **#30DaysOfPythonChallenge**. Today’s project is all about working with strings — validating user input and extracting meaningful data from it.

---

## 📌 What’s This About?
Today’s focus: **Strings and String Methods in Python** — learning how to manipulate, validate, and extract content using powerful built-in string operations.

---

## 💭 Why Build This?
Handling user input is a huge part of real-world apps. This project teaches how to:
- Validate emails with basic checks
- Clean up and format input
- Extract useful parts like the username

---

## ✨ Features

Here’s what the program does:
- ✅ Validates if a string looks like a valid email (contains `@` and `.`)
- 🔍 Uses `.strip()`, `.lower()`, and other methods to clean the input
- 🧾 Extracts the **username** part before the `@`
- 🧪 Demonstrates slicing and method chaining
- 💡 Shows errors or success messages in a clear, friendly way

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stuff

Built with:
- 🐍 **Python 3**
- 🔤 String methods like `.strip()`, `.lower()`, `.replace()`, `.split()`
- 📏 Slicing and length checks
- 🔎 The `in` keyword for validation logic
